# User Integrations

A user integration is a unique instance of integration of your application by a user. For instance, if you have built a GMail application on YellowAnt with invoke\_name as 'gmail', and a user has two Gmail accounts, the user can create two user integrations with your application. WHen the user integrate his/her first Gmail account, the integration will have a user\_invoke\_name as **gmail, **whereas the second email account will have the user\_invoke\_name as **gmail-1.**
